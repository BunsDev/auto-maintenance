## Auto-Maintenance
An all in one friendly application to keep track of your car and road bike service history.
  - Oil changes, car washes, keeping track of parts lifespan.
  -  Creates a local log of service history that is categorized if you ever decide to not keep on using my application.

### Current Application 
- Need to sort out a few bugs and make it look prettier but the functionality is there, I'll update as I get the time.
  - Thinking of adding reminders or timers for todo things, on the upper right side like "Oil Change due on XX/XX/XX + a count down timer for it once that date arrives it'll send a notificion to your system"
